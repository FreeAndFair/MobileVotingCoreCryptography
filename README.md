# Tusk Mobile Voting

This is the primary repository for [Free & Fair](https://freeandfair.us/)â€™s work on the [Tusk Philanthropies](https://tuskphilanthropies.org/)/Free Democracy Foundation [mobile voting project](https://mobilevoting.org/), which is being carried out using the Rigorous Digital Engineering methodology. The initial goal of this work is to develop the cryptographic core of an end-to-end verifiable Internet voting (E2E-VIV) system.

## Information

- The [team documentation](./docs/team.md) contains information for the team about how development is carried out in this and related project repositories, team communication standards, etc.
- The [continuous integration/deployment/verification documentation](./docs/ci_cd_cv.md) contains information about what artifacts are checked/created/verified in the repository (and related repositories) via continuous integration, deployment, and verification.
- In order to understand the modeling we are focused on at a high level, a white paper called "Refinements between High-Level Models" is available as part of our [releases](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/TuskMobileVoting/releases).  Its target audience is computer scientists/mathematicians who have a basic understanding of rigorous modeling.
- Other documentation/information will be added as appropriate.
