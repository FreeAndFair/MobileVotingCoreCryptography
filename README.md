# Mobile Voting Core Cryptography

This is the primary repository for [Free & Fair](https://freeandfair.us/)â€™s work on the [Tusk Philanthropies](https://tuskphilanthropies.org/)/Free Democracy Foundation [Mobile Voting Project](https://mobilevoting.org/), which is being carried out using the Rigorous Digital Engineering methodology. The goal of this work is to develop the cryptographic core of an end-to-end verifiable Internet voting (E2E-VIV) system.
