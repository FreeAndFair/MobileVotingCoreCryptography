# Lando Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the Lando System Specification Language, which is used for various modeling tasks in this project:

- [Language Grammar](./grammar-v2.pdf)
- [Well-Formedness Definitions](./well-formedness-v2.pdf)

Lando is a work in progress (see, e.g., the tooling in the public repository at [GaloisInc/BESSPIN-Lando](https://github.com/GaloisInc/BESSPIN-Lando)), and this documentation will be updated as necessary to stay up-to-date with the version of the tooling we use in this project.
