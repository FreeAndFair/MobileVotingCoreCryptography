# Voter Authentication Subprotocol

## Phase 1 Initiation

### Initial Request Message

sender
: Voting Application (VA)

recipient
: Election Administration Server (EAS)

purpose
: This message registers the voter's intent to authenticate and associates a freshly generated key-pair with this authentication session.

***structure***

```rust
struct AuthReqMsg {
  election_hash : String, // Hash of the unique election configuration item.
  voter_public_key : String, // The public key of a public-private key pair freshly generated by the VA.
  signature : String, // Signature of the contents of this message signed by the voter_public_key.
}
```

channel properties
: The `election_hash` included in this message serves to prevent replaying of old messages from a different election in the context of this election.

### Initial Request Checks

1. The `election_hash` is the hash of the election configuration item for the current election.

### Initiate Authentication Request Message

sender
: Election Administration Server (EAS)

recipient
: Authentication Service (AS)

purpose
: This message creates the verification session with the third-party authentication session using the credentials of the election administration server.

***structure***

```json
{
    "project_id": "string", // An identifier specific to the voting system infrastructure used by the third-party authentication service to determine the verification flow for the authentication sessions we create.
    "api_key": "string" // The third-party authentication service API key specific to the EAS.
}
```

Note: This structure is specified in JSON reflecting the JSON API of our candidate vendor.

channel properties
: The assumptions for this channel is the security of TLS for connecting to and using the API provided by the authentication service.

### Token Return Message

sender
: Authentication Service (AS)

recipient
: Election Administration Server (EAS)

purpose
: This message returns a token which can be given to the user wishing to authenticate with the authentication service and a session id retained by the server who initiated the request. The session id is later used to query the authentication service for the results of the authentication attempt.

***structure***

```json
{
    "token": "string", // Token to be used by the client to start an authentication session.
    "session_id": "string" // A session identifier to be used by the server to request authentication session information tied to the associated token.
}
```

Note: This structure is specified in JSON reflecting the JSON API of our candidate vendor.

channel properties
: The assumptions for this channel is the security of TLS for connecting to and using the API provided by the authentication service.

### Session Information Storage

The EAS stores the token, session ID, and public key in its database.

***structure***

```rust
// This is data that is written to storage not sent as a message
struct AuthSessionRecord {
  election_hash : String, // Hash of the unique election configuration item.
  voter_public_key : String, // Public key from the Initial Request Message
  token : String, // Token from the Token Return Message.
  session_id : String, // Session identifier from the Token Return Message.
}
```

### Voter Token Return Message

sender
: Election Administration Server (EAS)

recipient
: Voting Application

purpose
: This message communicates the token used to begin an authentication session with the authentication service. The message also confirms which public key the election administration server has associated with this authentication session.

***structure***

```rust
struct HandTokenMsg {
  election_hash : String, // Hash of the unique election configuration item.
  token : String, // Token from the Token Return Message.
  voter_public_key : String, // Public key from the Initial Request Message.
  signature : String, // Signature of the contents of this message signed by the EAS.
}
```

channel properties
: The `signature` is intended to provide *integrity* and *authenticity* over the token and the public key the election administration server has associated it with. Notably, confidentiality is not intended for this channel as the token can only be used to being an authentication session which confidential authentication information is needed to proceed with.

### Voter Token Return Checks

1. The `election_hash` is the hash of the election configuration item for the current election.
2. The `voter_public_key` is the voting application's public key.
3. The `signature` is a valid signature over the message contents signed by the election administration server signing key.

## Phase 2 Third-Party Authentication

The VA and the AS directly send message back and forth according to the AS protocol. The end result of which is the AS will store the authentication data of the voter using the VA and notify the VA when the authentication process is complete.

## Phase 3 Validation of Authentication

### Validation Request Message

sender
: Voting Application (VA)

recipient
: Election Administration Server (EAS)

purpose
: This message notifies the election administration server that the third-party authentication step has been completed and the voter is requesting the election administration server connect to the authentication service directly to query the results of the authentication session.

***structure***

```rust
struct AuthFinishMsg {
  election_hash : String, // Hash of the unique election configuration item.
  token : String, // Token from the Token Return Message.
  public_key : String, // Public Key from the initial request message.
  signature : String, // Signature of the contents of this message signed by the public key from the Initial Request Message,
}
```

channel properties
: The `signature` intends to provide *integrity* and *authenticity* over the contents of the message. As the message only contains publicly known data there isn't a need for confidentiality.

### Validation Request Checks

1. The `election_hash` is the hash of the election configuration item for the current election.
2. The `token` matches one `AuthSessionRecord.token`.
3. The `public_key` matches the `AuthSessionRecord.public_key` from check #2.
4. The `signature` is a valid signature over the message contents signed by the `public_key`.

### Validation Request Processing

The EAS retrieves the session ID from storage using the public key which signed the begin validation message. If a session ID is found the *Request Session Data Message* is sent otherwise the *No Session Found Message* is sent.

### Authentication Service Query Message

sender
: Election Administration Server (EAS)

recipient
: Authentication Service (AS)

purpose
: This message requests the authentication data associated with the session ID.

***structure***

```json
{
    "session_id": "string", // The session ID retrieved from EAS storage based on the public key used to sign the Validation Request Message.
    "api_key": "string" // The third-party authentication service API key specific to the EAS.
}
```

Note: This structure is specified in JSON reflecting the JSON API of our candidate vendor.

channel properties
: The assumptions for this channel is the security of TLS for connecting to and using the API provided by the authentication service.

### Authentication Service Report Message

sender
: Authentication Service (AS)

recipient
: Election Administration Server (EAS)

purpose
: This message returns the result of the authentication session from the *Authentication Service Query Message* and the information used in the authentication decision. If the authentication was successful, the authentication service sends its ground truth data concerning the authenticated person.

## Phase 4 Voter Authorization

### Authorization Checks

1. Biographical information from the *Authentication Service Report Message* match a registered voter in the voter registration database.
2. The `token` in the *Authentication Service Report Message* matches one `AuthSessionRecord.token`.

### Authorize Voter Message

sender
: Election Administration Server (EAS)

recipient
: Digital Ballot Box (DBB)

purpose
: This message is sent from the election administration server to the digital ballot box  authorizing the acceptance of ballot submission and ballot casting messages signed by the `voter_public_key` representing votes from the voter with pseudonym `voter_pseudonym`. This authorization will be stored in a table in the digital ballot box keyed by `voter_pseudonym`.

***structure***

```rust
struct AuthVoterMsg {
  election_hash : String, // Hash of the unique election configuration item.
  voter_pseudonym : String, // Unique identifier for the voter retrieved from the EAS voter registration database.
  voter_public_key : String, // Public key from the Initial Request Message.
  ballot_style : String, // Ballot style this voter is authorized to cast retrieved from the EAS voter registration database and the election manifest.
  signature : String, // Signature of the contents of this message signed by the EAS.
}
```

channel properties
: The signature by the Election Administration Server is intended to provide *integrity* over the contents of the message and *authentication* for the digital ballot box.

### Authorize Voter Checks

1. The `election_hash` is the hash of the election configuration item for the current election.
2. The `voter_pseudonym` is present and a well formed identifier.
3. The `voter_public_key` is present and a well formed public key from a supported cryptosystem.
4. The `ballot_style` is a valid ballot style for this election.
5. The `signature` is a valid signature over the message contents signed by the election administration server signing key.

### Confirm Authorization Message

sender
: Election Administration Server (EAS)

recipient
: Voting Application

purpose
: This message copies the message authorizing the public key for voting and sends it to the voter confirming they are authorized to vote. This message also informs the voter of their officially registered ballot style.

***structure***

```rust
struct ConfirmAuthorizationMessage {
    election_hash : String, // Hash of the unique election configuration item.
    voter_pseudonym : String, // Unique identifier for the voter retrieved from the EAS voter registration database.
    voter_public_key : String, // Public key from the Initial Request Message.
    ballot_style : String, // Ballot style this voter is authorized to cast retrieved from the EAS voter registration database and the election manifest.
    authentication_result : String, // Result indicating if the voter was authenticated by the authentication service and if they are registered to vote in this election.
    signature : String, // Signature of the contents of this message signed by the EAS.
}
```

channel properties
: The signature by the Election Administration Server is intended to provide *integrity* over the contents of the message and *authentication* for the voting application.

### Confirm Authorization Checks

1. The `election_hash` is the hash of the election configuration item for the current election.
2. The `voter_pseudonym` is present and a well formed identifier.
3. The `voter_public_key` is the voting application's public key.
4. The `ballot_style` is a valid ballot style for this election.
5. The `signature` is a valid signature over the message contents signed by the election administration server signing key.
