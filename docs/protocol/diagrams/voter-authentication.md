    participant VA as "Voting Application"
    participant UserAgent as "Voter's User Agent/Browser"
    participant EAS as "Election Admin Server"

    VA->>EAS: Request Authentication for Voter (PublicKey: P)
    activate VA
    activate EAS
    EAS->>AS: Initiate Authentication Request
    activate AS
    AS-->>EAS: Provide Session Info (SessionID: S, AuthToken: T)
    # AS is now ready for the user authentication step via redirect

    EAS->>VA: Provide Auth Token (Token: T, For PublicKey: P)

    Note over VA: Prepare redirection for user
    VA->>UserAgent: Redirect User to AS Authentication URL (embedding Token T)
    deactivate VA ## VA waits for callback/redirect completion
    activate UserAgent

    UserAgent->>AS: Access Authentication URL (Token: T)

    VA->>EAS: Notify: Authentication Process Finished (Token: T)

    EAS->>AS: Query Authentication Result (SessionID: S)
    activate AS
    AS-->>EAS: Report Authentication Result for Session S (Status: Success) ## Happy Path: Authentication Succeeded
    deactivate AS

    # --- Happy Path Steps ---
    Note over EAS: Look up voter info, Check Eligibility using PublicKey P ## Happy Path: Voter is Eligible
