# E2E-VIV Domain Model

This directory contains the domain model for an E2E-VIV system, including a [glossary](./lando/domain.lando); [events](./lando/events.lando), [scenarios](./lando/scenarios.lando), and [actors](./lando/protocol_actors.lando) for the E2E-VIV protocol; and a set of [requirements](./lando/requirements/) for the E2E-VIV protocol. It also contains, in the [NLP submodule](./NLP), a [natural language processing tool](./NLP/phrases/), the scripts that were used to run it on domain primary sources, and the raw and processed outputs of those runs that helped inform the domain model.

The domain model glossary covers the entirety of an E2E-VIV system, while the other domain model components cover only the E2E-VIV protocol core library we are implementing as part of this project.
