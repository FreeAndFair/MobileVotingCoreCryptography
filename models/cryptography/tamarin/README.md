# Tamarin Model for E2E-VIV Core Cryptography

This directory contains [Tamarin](https://tamarin-prover.com/) models for the E2E-VIV core cryptographic protocol, as described in [the cryptographic protocol documentation](repo-location-to-be-determined). The models use Tamarin's rule-based syntax, rather than its pi-calculus syntax, primarily for better understandability when working with them interactively in Tamarin's user interface. Each subprotocol has its own model written in a way that supports basic _modularity_: each can be reasoned about independently, as well as when combined with (some or all of) the other subprotocols. This is accomplished with a combination of `m4` macros and Tamarin include directives, which the accompanying [Makefile](./Makefile) handles automatically for its various targets (these can be listed with `make help`).

In the current iteration of the E2E-VIV Core Cryptography project, our statement of work includes performing formal protocol _specification_ but not formal protocol _verification_. Nonetheless, we demonstrate via executability lemmas that each role within each of the subprotocols is executable (including appropriate handling of error situations), both in isolation and when combined with the other subprotocols. We also opportunistically include lemmas for desirable security properties, but do not prove them in all cases; the verification state of each such lemma is described alongside its declaration, and the verification targets in the `Makefile` that are run during continuous verification (currently) verify only the executability lemmas.
