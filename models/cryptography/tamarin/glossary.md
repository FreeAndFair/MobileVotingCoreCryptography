# Glossary

This file summarizes the Tamarin constructs (functions, equational theories, roles, state and action facts) that are used across the various subprotocols within E2E-VIV Core Cryptography model. It includes (at least for now) only those state and action facts that are shared across subprotocols.

Note that some state and action facts must be "mocked" when examining subprotocols in isolation (for example, when examining the ballot submission subprotocol without the authentication subprotocol, the voting application in the former must still get a public/private key pair for the voter from somewhere). The information in this file should enhance the understandability of such mocks.
