dnl This is the m4 input file for the Election Key Generation Subprotocol.
dnl If the STANDALONE macro is defined, this file generates a standalone
dnl version of the subprotocol; otherwise, it generates a Tamarin code
dnl snippet suitable for inclusion in a Tamarin file composing multiple
dnl subprotocols.
dnl
dnl If the ELECTION_KEY_GENERATION_MOCKS macro is defined (which is always
dnl the case when STANDALONE is defined), the Tamarin code snippet will
dnl include mock rules that simulate required actions of other subprotocols
dnl by establishing suitable linear/persistent/action facts.

dnl We change the m4 quote characters to <! and !>, so that they don't
dnl interfere with Tamarin's quote characters or any comments we might
dnl want to write. The incantation below makes that change, and ensures
dnl that we don't try to change them if we've already done so (e.g.,
dnl when including this file in a composition).
