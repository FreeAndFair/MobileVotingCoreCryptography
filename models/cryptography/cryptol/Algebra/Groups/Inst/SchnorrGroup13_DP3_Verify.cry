 * @note Even for small DirectProduct groups, we current
 * cannot prove that g is a generator of the group. This
 * is because the g_generates_G property is not usable in
 * this context.
 *
 * @note The default `enc` and `dec` functions are not
 * implemented in Schnorr Groups where r != 2. Hence,
 * we do not try to verify properties about them here.
